By Thomas Deeb

Practice for a basic turn-based RPG battle system in SFML.NET.

The goal is to create a flexible battle system with the following features:  
-[x]Turn order based on speed, with order differing depending on speed mods during battle  
-[ ]Status effects (modifies stats, damage per turn, restricts actions such as magic use)  
-[x]Items (damage, healing, status) and inventory  
-[ ]Magic (# of turns to cast, target multiple enemies, % chance for inflicting status effects)  
-[x]Character and enemy exclusive actions and spells, which can be easily added or moved to   different characters and enemies
