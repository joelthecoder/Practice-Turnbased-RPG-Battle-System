# Practice-Turnbased-RPG-Battle-System
By Thomas Deeb

Practice for a basic turn-based RPG battle system in SFML.NET.

The goal is to create a flexible battle system with the following features:
-Turn order based on speed, with order differing depending on speed mods during battle
-Status effects (modifies stats, damage per turn, restricts actions such as magic use)
-Items (damage, healing, status) and inventory
-Magic (# of turns to cast, target multiple enemies, % chance for inflicting status effects)
-Character and enemy exclusive actions and spells, which can be easily added or moved to different characters and enemies
